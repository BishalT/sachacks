# SACHACKS

#### To start working on this project, Pls run the following commands in order

1. Download all modules needed
```
npm install
```

2. Start a dev server at http://localhost:8080/
```
npm run start
```
**NOTE**: This command will run a server at localhost, there is **nothing** built yet. Therefore, what you see after run this command is not same as what you see when you deploy this website

3. Build file for deploying website
``` 
npm run build
```
**NOTE**: This command will build/combine everything into a single *bundle.js* where is consumed by *html file*. Thus, this will be what you see if you open html directly without running **2nd command**.
